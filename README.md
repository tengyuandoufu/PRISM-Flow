# PRISM-Flow：Unsupervised Cross-Modal Medical Image Registration via Optical Flow with Geometric Prior Guidance
There is no time to release the code now because there are still supplementary materials that have not been written. We will wait for this month and the code will be released gradually.
# 🔨 1.Setup
## 1.1 Requirements

# 📁 2.Dataset Preparation
This project uses data from the [ADNI-4 dataset](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/)  and [SynthRAD2025 Grand Challenge dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/14918089), specifically:
## 2.1 SynthRAD2025 dataset：
-Task 1 (MRI-to-CT) 
-Task 2 (CBCT-to-CT)
-Within each task, cases are categorized into three anatomical regions:
Head-and-neck (HN)
Thorax (TH)
Abdomen (AB)
